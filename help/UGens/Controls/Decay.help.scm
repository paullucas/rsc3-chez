;; (Decay in decayTime)			

;; Exponential decay.  This is essentially the same as Integrator
;; except that instead of supplying the coefficient directly, it is
;; caculated from a 60 dB decay time. This is the time required for
;; the integrator to lose 99.9 % of its value or -60dB. This is useful
;; for exponential decaying envelopes triggered by impulses.

;; Used as an envelope.
