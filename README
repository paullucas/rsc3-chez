rsc3 supercollider client

[rsc3][rsc3] is a an [r6rs][r6rs] ([ikarus][ikarus], [plt][plt])
scheme module for working with the [supercollider][sc3] synthesis
server.  the rsc3 interaction environment
([rsc3.el](?t=rsc3&e=emacs/rsc3.el)) is written for gnu
[emacs][emacs].

for installation and configuration please consult the
[tutorial][rsc3-t] at [rsc3-texts][rsc3-texts].

there are a number of related projects:

- [rsc3-arf](?t=rsc3-arf): alternate rate flow for ugen graphs
- [rsc3-dot](?t=rsc3-dot): ugen graph drawing
- [rsc3-disassembler](?t=rsc3-disassembler): synth graph disassembler
- [rsc3-lang](?t=rsc3-lang): supercollider language variants
- [rsc3-midi](?t=rsc3-midi): musical instrument digital interface
- [rsc3-sdif](?t=rsc3-sdif): sound description interchange format
- [hsc3-lisp](?t=hsc3-lisp): a lisp interpeter, sc3 ugens are the only type

there is a small set of example [graphs](?t=rsc3&e=md/graphs.md).
these mostly are written to also work with `hsc3-lisp`,
& assume that `~/.rsc3` has:
